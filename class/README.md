Consider two aspects which are `has(attributes)` and `does(methods)`.

- class
  - blueprint
  - code template for creating program objects
- All objects have: 
  - Identity
  - Attributes
  - Behaviors
- Attribute
- method
  - A block of code or program procedure that can be called to perform some actions and it may return a value
  - Defined as a part of class.

Class components
- Name: What is it?
- Attributes: What describe it?
- Behavior: What can do it?
